UArduinoUno,1,Arduino uno  Well known development board that makes it easy to receive sensorinput and control electrical components with code. The Uno is the most widely used Arduino.,ARDUINO,"// Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
// give it a name:
int led = 13;
int sensor = A0;
int sensorValue = 0;

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(sensor, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
  sensorValue = analogRead(sensor); 
  Serial.print(""HIGH : "");
  Serial.print(sensorValue);
  
  digitalWrite(led, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
  sensorValue = analogRead(sensor); 
  Serial.print("", LOW: "");
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
